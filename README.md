<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->
<h1 align="center"> Project Description</h1>

This project was intended to create my portfolio that highlights my projects so far. It includes an about me section, a link to my resume, as well as different methods of contacting me. The goal is to continue updating my portfolio as the bootcamp and my skills progress. I used HTML and CSS to create and style the project.
