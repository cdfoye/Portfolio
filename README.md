<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->
<h1 align="center"> Project Description</h1>

This project refactors the codebase for marketing agency "Horiseon" to add accessibility features to the website. To achieve this, the following modifications were made:

- Semantic HMTML elements added
- Alt attributes for icon and image elements
- Reorganized headings to fall in sequential order
- Descriptive title

Additionally, the CSS selectors and properties were consoliated and reorganized to follow the semantic elements of the HTML code. Comments were added to both the CSS and HTML files.
