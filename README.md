<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->
<h1 align="center"> Description</h1>

This project contains my portfolio that highlights top projects completed during the full stack coding boot camp. It includes an about me section, a link to my resume, as well as different methods of contacting me. The goal is to continue updating my portfolio as the bootcamp and my skills progress. I used HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to create and style the project.
